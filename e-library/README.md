# E-Library

This is a very simple E-Library that allows the user to check data about books.

I decided to do this Educative Project ( https://www.educative.io/collection/page/10370001/6648093265362944/5343039484854272/project ) in order to become familiar with Next.js and with styling with Tailwind CSS.

### Execution Instructions

1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
2. Run `npm start` to start the application
