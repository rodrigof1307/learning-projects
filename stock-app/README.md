# Stock App

This is a very simple Stocks app that allows the user to check data about trending stocks.

It uses YH Finance API ( https://www.financeapi.net ) and since this is an un important learning project I have left the API key for my free tier account on the .env file.

I decided to do this Educative Project https://www.educative.io/collection/page/10370001/5089245029203968/4756844222611456/project in order to practice in order to become familiar with styling with Bootstrap as well as to practice my React.js knowledge.

### Execution Instructions

1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
2. Run `npm start` to start the application
